# github-pr

## About this project
github-pr is a simple emacs package for easier reviewing Github PR without leaving emacs. This also the project that I used to learn elisp (I created this package after learned about elisp for a few hours so I'm not sure if this project will survive :smile:)

## Todo
- [ ] List all PRs in menu for user to pick
- [ ] Checkout PR
- [ ] Maybe add comment on PR if that possible :smile:
- [ ] Label a PR is also a good feature
- [ ] I can't think of anything else

## License
